Contents
This Assignment contains UDPClient.java, UDPProxy.java, UDPServer1.java, UDPServer2.java,
README.md and Makefile
### To compile you can use the Makefile
  - To run this
    - run `make build` in current directory to compile all the files




### Attention
Run the UDPservers first `Note` the server will only wait for 15 seconds before
a `SocketTimeoutException` is thrown

then

run `java UDPProxy` and `java UDPClient` last
## Description
For this Assignment we use port `7000` UDPServer1 and port `6000` for UDPServer2

#Purpose
The purpose of this is Assignment is to allow you to experiment with client server
 programming in Java as a building block of building more complex concurrent systems
 in the future. You will be experimenting with UDP programming in Java for this assignment
