#Project Specification
This project design and implement a file transfer system based on the TFTP protocol
specification which is available on the course website.
Ã¬README.txt file explaining the names of your files, set up instructions, etc.
Breakdown of responsibilities of each team member for this iteration
UML class diagram
UCMs for a read file transfer and a write file transfer, including the error simulator
Detailed set up and test instructions, including test files used
Code (.java files, all required Eclipse files, etc.)

#Responsibilities
**responsibilities
  -> Naol - Client.java, README file and timing diagrams
    -> Melaku - TftpServer.java, TftpServerControl.java and TftpClientConnectionThread.java
      -> Raymond Wu - Packet class, ErrorSimulator
        -> Chengyang Liu - UML diagram and TftpError.java
          -> Keith Ko - ErrorSimulator


##Instruction to Run
Please place files to write in the clientFiles folder
and files to read in the serverFiles folder.
Files that are read from the server and read from the serverFiles folder and transferred into the clientFiles folder.
Files that are written from the client to the server are written from the clientFiles folder to the serverFiles folder.
To start:
1. Start Server
  2. Start ErrorSimulator (not necessary if in normal mode but won't affect program)
    3. Start Client
    	-Type in one of available commands


#Issue
-Right now ErrorSimulator can not exit, there is a thread written up that
	does this similar to our serverShutdown thread.  However this method requires checking
	constantly for the users input for 'quit' but when error sim checks what error the
	user would like to do then its taking the input for the shutdown thread over the asking
	error.  We couldn't think of a way to fix this, any suggestions?
